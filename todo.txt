- Daleâ€™s comments
	- bug
	- refactor duplicate parts in checkSaveBeforeCompile and closeTab, probably
- restoring behavior where tab header text color changes when file has unsaved changes (I was trying using an EventFilter on the tab pane, but it colored all of the tabs instead of just the one)




New Considerations:

-Consider moving set...() etc code into Constructors in relevant controllers
-Consider deleting unhelpful jdocs over FXML fields
-Do something about ugly binding code @ Controller:212?
-Rename SetButtonBinding in Controller because it does more
or, separate out functionality the doesn't belong?
