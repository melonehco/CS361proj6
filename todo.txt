- Daleâ€™s comments
	- bug
	- refactor duplicate parts in checkSaveBeforeCompile and closeTab, probably
- when taking out initial untitled tab, make handleTextChange private (currently used in Controller in method attached to initial tab)
	- probably moving changing tab title to green to a handler attached to tab pane




New Considerations:

-Consider moving set...() etc code into Constructors in relevant controllers
-Consider deleting unhelpful jdocs over FXML fields
-Sicker button css/ maybe updated css in general?
-Do something about ugly binding code @ Controller:212?
